// Would be interesting to check on championships with different timezones, and then compare the differencies in odds according to the difference between timezones.

I suggest to give a couple of variables (x, y) to each championship. 
x would be the UTC timezone of the championship.
y would be the variable of the reference timezone.

For now, the reference timezone is PARIS timezone: UTC +1 

ex: 
	(-3, 1) represent a timezone UTC -3 compared to Paris timezone
	(-4, 1) represent a timezone UTC -4 compared to Paris timezone

Then, we will be able to analyse the relevancy of each championship based on that couple of variables.
// 



Sports to track:

	- SOCCER
		* USA championship (NY timezone: UTC -4 => -5h difference with Paris) // socc_usa = (-4, -5)
		* Brazilian championship (Rio de Janeiro Timezone: UTC -3 => -4h difference with Paris) socc_bra = (-3, -4)
		* Chile championship (Santiago de Chile timezone: UTC -3 => -4h difference with Paris)
		* Chinese championship (Beijin timezone: UTC +8 => +7h difference with Paris)

	- BASKETBALL:
		* NBA (NY timezone: UTC -4 => -4h difference with Paris)
		* Chinese championship (Beijin timezone: UTC +8 => +7h difference with Paris)
